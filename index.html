            You wake up to find yourself lying on the damp ground in the middle of a dense forest. Your head is throbbing, and your body aches all over. You look around, and nothing looks familiar. You have no memory of how you got here. The forest is eerily quiet, except for the sound of rustling leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl in the distance. You realize you must find a way out of this forest and back to civilization. You stand up, dust yourself off, and take a deep breath. You notice a bag lying next to you. As you examine the bag, you find a map, a torch, and a small knife. It seems like these items will come in handy on your journey. You put them in your backpack and begin your adventure into the unknown.
